# City of Cape Town Data Science Challenge

## Problems

In this repo I have provided solutions for the three tasks relevant to the Data Scientist position.
* 2. Initial Data Transformation - joining the service request data to geospatial hex data.
* 4. Predictive Analytic Tasks Timeseries
* 4. Predictive Analytic Tasks Computer Vision

## Solutions

The resepective solutions are self-contained in Python Notebooks
* `geohex.ipynb`
* `timeseries.ipynb`
* `computer_vision.ipynb`

## Requirements

All requirements are in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Training logs
Tensorboard logs for the computer vision task are included in `lightning_logs/` and can be viewed using tensorboard.

`tensorboard --logdir lightning_logs`

## Git Log
Git was used throughout this project, with apropriate versioning and branching. Here is a copy of the Git Log.
